# C and Rust versions of Coreutils

This directory contains the C and equivalent Rust translations of some coreutils
programs. The C version was taken from the
[coreutils mirror](https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils). The Rust version was
obtained by translating the C version using
[c2rust](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=c2rust) (see
the `create_corpus.sh` script for how this is done).

This directory also contains the end-to-end tests for each program included
in the coreutils repository (more details below).

## Directory structure

### Source code

Each program's source code is located within the `src/<prog_name>/` directory.
There is the C version in `src/<prog_name>/c/` and the Rust version in
`src/<prog_name>/rust/`.

The C and Rust directories for each program are self-contained (all files
needed to compile the program are within the respective directories).

#### C version

To build the C version of a program, run the `make` command from
`src/<prog_name>/c/`. This will generate an executable also called
`prog_name`.

#### Rust version

To build the Rust version of a program, run `cargo build` (or
`cargo build --release` for the release version) from within the
`src/<prog_name>/rust` directory. This will generate an executable within the
`src/<prog_name>/rust/target/` directory.

### Test scripts

All test scripts are contained within the `tests/` directory. The `tests/`
directory contains the `init.sh` script, which defines some common functions
used by the test scripts. The test cases for each program is within the
`tests/<prog_name>/` directory.

#### Running the tests

To run a test, you must execute the script from this subdirectory (i.e. outside
of `tests/`).

You must also supply the directory containing the executable to test.

For example, to execute one of the tests on the **C version** of cat, you could
run the following command (note that the executable has to be built beforehand):

```sh
$ ./tests/cat/cat-E.sh ./src/cat/c
```

Similarly, to test the **Rust version** of cat, you could execute the following
command (after building the executable with `cargo build --release`):

```sh
$ ./tests/cat/cat-E.sh ./src/cat/rust/target/release
```

#### Return codes

Each script will return the following exit codes to indicate the result of the
test:

* Success: 0
* Skipped: 77
* Failure: 1

## Program status

The following is the status for each program.

### Working programs
* cat
* cut
* dirname
* echo
* false
* head
* join
* kill
* paste
* pwd
